  <h2>How do I rename an existing plugin?</h2>

  <h3>Changing the plugin display name</h3>
  <p>
    At present, the plugin display name can only be changed via the administration interface, and it requires additional verification. 
    To request a name change for an existing QGIS plugin, please contact the QGIS Plugin Administration team by emailing 
    <a href="mailto:tim@katoza.com">tim@katoza.com</a> and <a href="mailto:lova@kartoza.com">lova@kartoza.com</a> from the plugin author's email address.
  </p>

  <h3>Renaming the directory (also known as <code>package_name</code>)</h3>
  <p>
    This functionality was previously requested but has since been discontinued. 
    It is strongly recommended to keep the original plugin identifier (directory name) to avoid compatibility issues. 
    Changing the <code>package_name</code> may cause QGIS to treat the plugin as uninstalled, 
    which can result in errors during installation.
